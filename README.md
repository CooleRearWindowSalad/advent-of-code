# Advent of Code 2025 - Solutions

This repository contains my **Advent of Code 2025** solutions, written in Python.  
Each day's puzzle has its own solution script and uses a separate input file (kept out of version control).

## Website
All puzzles come from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Project Structure
advent-of-code/
└─ 2025/
├─ advent1.py (# Day 1 solution)
├─ advent2.py (# Day 2 solution)
├─ ... # Other days
└─ *.txt # Input files for each day (gitignored)


- **Solution scripts** (`adventN.py`) are self-contained and read their input from the corresponding `.txt` file.  
- **Input files** are **ignored by Git** (`*.txt`) to keep my puzzle inputs private.

## Usage

Run a day's solution from the command line:

```bash
python advent-of-code/2025/advent1.py
python advent-of-code/2025/advent2.py
